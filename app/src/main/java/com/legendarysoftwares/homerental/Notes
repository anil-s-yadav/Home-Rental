                    .setPhotoUri(uri)
                    .build();

their are a imageview on my top right corner at chat activity named as "tv_accept_request".
now i want to do, this tv is visible only that person who is chatting with me, as myself being a
current user should not be visible.
why,this button, let me explain...
While I am brousing properties on my home fragment, I choose a property and by using above
send request button I send a request to the property owner. Now while chatting with that owner
This textView "tv_accept_request" which have all information about thet property should be visible
 to the owner so he can aprove this property. this textView has text "Accept for rent" for the
 owner and "aproveal panding" for me, who send the request. after aproved by the owner that
 property will be reflact in my "PayRentActivity" and owner's "CollectRentActivity" . how to implement this feature.
